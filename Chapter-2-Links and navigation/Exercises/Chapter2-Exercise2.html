<!--### One-page website:

Pick a television series, film or game and design a really simple one-page website (just text, no images). Your website should include:

* An overview of the plot, key information, cast and/or creative team, characters and any reviews you can find. 
* A nav bar at the top which allows the user to quickly navigate to sections further down the page (anchor Ids).
* A link to the actual website of the film/game etc. which opens in a new tab when clicked. 
* Use of an external CSS file to style elements creatively (avoid inline styling and use classes instead).
* At least two classes. 
* One link styled as a button.-->

                        So, there's this little fish named Oscar, bit of a dreamer but stuck in a dead-end job cleaning whales' tongues. He's not exactly living the high life. Anyway, things get wild when the son of a notorious shark mob
                        boss gets accidentally whacked, and Oscar ends up taking credit for it!
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        This throws him into the deep end (pun intended) because the boss, a real tough guy voiced by Robert De Niro, is after revenge. Oscar teams up with the shark's surprisingly vegetarian brother, Lenny (think Jack Black
                        as a peace-loving shark), to keep up the whole "shark slayer" act. It's hilarious chaos as Oscar tries to navigate this crazy underworld while Lenny wrestles with his non-predatory urges.
                        <br />
                        <br />
                        Will Oscar come clean? Will Lenny learn to, you know, actually eat meat? You'll have to dive into the movie to find out! It's a fun ride with some great characters and a whole lot of undersea adventure.

                            The Godfather, Goodfellas, The Irishman, and Shark Tale all have two things in common: Robert De Niro and the mafia… But only one of these films also features animated sharks, so I ask you, which film is the real
                            cinema classic?
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            DreamWorks Studio and Oscar-nominated (I’m not joking!) 2004 feature Shark Tale is an underrated masterpiece, despite what any haters say! It's got everything you could ever ask for: humour, a strong moral
                            centre, sexy fish, and even the mob. No matter how old you are, there is something to grab your attention in this film! Each time you watch it, a new joke pops up or a quote sticks in your head. It's a top tier
                            cinematic experience that should get more love!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Shark Tale’s star-studded voice cast is quite the catch, too… The cast have perfect comedic chemistry and they bring their real-life personas to their animated fishy counterparts. From Will Smith, Jack Black,
                            Robert De Niro, Angelina Jolie, Bob Marley’s son and even Martin Scorsese!
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            At every turn, there are fish puns that you can’t help but smile and roll your eyes at like the seahorse race track, Coral-Cola billboards, and the ever-informative news reporter, Katie Current… The soundtrack,
                            which keeps the momentum going through the whole film, is a perfect early 2000s gem of a track that includes many hit songs, and a Hans Zimmer score to round it all out.
                            <br />
                            <br />
                            Yes, it's technically a gangster film… Yes, it’s FULL of fish puns! But the messages of accepting who you are and the damage that lying can do are timeless. Through tense trials and the power of real friendship,
                            the characters learn to accept themselves and live in their truths. It's powerful and raw and more importantly, a lesson people of all ages can resonate with.

                            Shark Tale is definitely one of the best movies that I have ever seen in my life. The story may seem basic but the action and drama that it brings is something that should not be pointed out. Moments of true
                            emotion are seen throughout the story with many being some of if not the most memorable I have seen. The voice actors did a fanominal job as they bring some of the best acting I have heard in years. As expected
                            from dreamworks they have chose some of the best actor choices as each feels fit for the characters they potray. The movie is also really funny. It is so funny that I fell from my chair. This is my favorite movie
                            and I would without a doubt recommend it to anyone else that comes across it. P.S. - I didnt like the whale wash scene. It was a little spooky for me to fully enjoy with how realistic they looked
